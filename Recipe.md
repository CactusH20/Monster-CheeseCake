Method
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a loaf tin with a little vegetable oil.

Beat the fromage frais with the egg until smooth and well combined.

Add half a pot of the sugar and three pots of the flour to the egg mixture and beat well. Add the chopped peach and vegetable oil and beat again.

Scrape the cake mixture into the prepared loaf tin and place the tin onto a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden-brown and a skewer inserted into its centre comes out clean. Set aside to cool, then slice.
